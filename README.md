# Horiseon-Refactor
Refactor of a web page by William Pate

## Description
This project was a refactor of an existing web page for the ficticious company, Horiseon Social Solution Services. A primary objective was to make the web page more accesssible by disabled visitors. Doing this also increases the rank of this web page in search engines (if it was an actual web page). Another primary objective was improving the HTML and css code by using semantic rather than non-semantic (that is, div) statments to improve readability and maintainability. It has to be said that this web page is a homework assignment so that any one finding this public project now and in the future will understand what it is exactly.

The web page before refactoring had the problems listed below in the changes and fixed section below.

## Changes and fixes
1. Added alt text to the images to improve the accesability of this web page.
2. Replaced a lot of div elements with section and aside elements. Not all divs needed to be replaced.
2. Fixed the link to the Search Engine Optimization section in the nav bar in the header.
3. Fixed the reference to the image for the Search Engine Optimization section.
4. Consolidated duplicate formats in the css file.
5. Reduce the size of the images by a factor of about 20 so that they download faster.
6. Added this README.md files.
7. Added comments to the HTML and css files.
